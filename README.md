# final-year-project

The purpose of this repository is to document work completed with regard to my Dissertation for Atlantic Technological University (Hons) Software Development - 2022/2023
This repository will contain the Applied Unity Project aswell as the accompanying dissertation.

The project itself is based off of my understanding of multiplayer network with an implementation of cross-platform compatibility through PC, VR and mobile. As this is an applied project my aim is to demonstrate these skills by developing a karting game that implements multiplayer networks and unified control systems.

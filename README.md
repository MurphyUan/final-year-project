# final-year-project

The purpose of this repository is to document work completed with regard to my Dissertation for Atlantic Technological University (Hons) Software Development - 2022/2023
This repository will contain the Applied Unity Project aswell as the accompanying dissertation.

This project was my opportunity to explore multiplayer networks and to implement said network into an arcade racing simulation. Unfortunately in its current state the project is not complete and barely functions as to speak. 

However if you do wish to test the functionality of the project. There is a simple build located in Builds that allow a player to connect to host a server and drive around in kart on a terrain. If you wish to view the dissertation accompanying this document navigate to the WriteUp Folder and there will a viewable pdf file along with all the latex files used to construct the dissertation
